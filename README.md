MathCask
========

MathCask is a quick starter kit for hosting your mathematical notes
and snippets as self-rendering, distributable HTML documents.  It
supports Markdown and MathJax-flavored LaTeX, making it easy to write
and distribute mathematical content.

You can use MathCask in multiple ways, depending on your technical
background.  If you're familiar with Git, GitHub, or Codeberg, you can
set up a convenient workflow for yourself where you commit your notes
into a Git repo and make them available online via GitHub pages or
Codeberg pages.  Alternatively, you can also host this kit on your
personal web server or web hosting space.

If you're not familiar with these tools, don't worry.  The first few
sections below provide a gentle guide to help you get started.

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/texme@1.2.2"></script><textarea>

     # Euler's Identity

     In mathematics, **Euler's identity** is the equality
     $$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$

     ## Explanation

     Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
     analysis, which states that for any real number $ x $,
     $$ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x. $$
     ```

  5. Finally, click **Commit changes**, review/change the commit
     message, and click **Commit changes** again.

  6. Wait for a few minutes for GitHub to publish your new HTML page.
     Assuming you had named it `foo.html`, now visit
     `https://USERNAME.github.io/mathcask/foo.html` and confirm the
     rendered page loads on your web browser.  The output should look
     like this: [example.html][example-gh].

Host On Your Own Web Server
---------------------------

You can also host self-rendering Markdown + LaTeX pages on your own
web server.  In fact, you do not even need this project to do so.  All
you need to do is add HTML files that contain a simple boilerplate
header to load [TeXMe][] followed by Markdown + LaTeX content.  Here
is an example such HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/texme@1.2.2"></script><textarea>

# Euler's Identity

In mathematics, **Euler's identity** is the equality
$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$

## Explanation

Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
analysis, which states that for any real number $ x $,
$$ e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x. $$
```

The first line of this file loads TeXMe.  The TeXMe parser parses the
remainder of the file and renders the Markdown and MathJax-flavoured
LaTeX in it.  To learn more about TeXMe, see
[github.com/susam/texme][TeXMe].

[TeXMe]: https://github.com/susam/texme#texme


How Does This Work?
-------------------

If you have looked at the HTML examples from earlier sections, you may
have noticed that they all begin with this line:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/texme@1.2.2"></script><textarea>
```

This line loads [TeXMe][], a lightweight tool that enables seamless
rendering of both Markdown and MathJax-flavored LaTeX within the same
HTML file.  TeXMe processes the remainder of the HTML file and invokes
a Markdown parser and a LaTeX renderer separately, ensuring that each
parser only interprets the content meant for it.  This prevents
conflicts and produces clean, high-quality output.

One of the important features of TeXMe is its conformance to the
GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM) specification.  Since GFM is an
extension of the CommonMark specification, TeXMe also conforms to the
CommonMark specification as a bonus.  To achieve this, TeXMe invokes a
very high quality Markdown parser called Marked that is known to parse
and render GFM text very accurately.  To render MathJax-flavoured
LaTeX, TeXMe invokes MathJax of course, ensuring accurate mathematical
typesetting.  To read more about TeXMe, visit

Why?
----

This quick starter kit was created as a substitute for MathB.in, a
mathematics pastebin that operated from March 2012 to March 2025.
After 13 years of service, MathB.in was shut down.  See the post
[MathB.in Is Shutting Down][shutdown] for more details on why it was
shut down.

MathB.in offered a very convenient way to quickly write down a short
mathematical snippet or post using Markdown and LaTeX and then
generate a distributable link for it with the click of a button.  This
service was powered by MathB, a free and open source software available
at [github.com/susam/mathb][mathb].

Users appreciated MathB.in for its ease of use and robust support for
GitHub Flavoured Markdown (GFM), and MathJax-powered LaTeX.  Since GFM
is a strict superset of CommonMark, the parsing and rendering of user
posts conformed to the CommonMark specification as well.

With the discontinuation of MathB.in, an alternative was needed.
While this kit is nowhere near as quick and convenient as MathB.in, it
does offer a reasonably easy way to set up your own little web space
for sharing your mathematical snippets and notes.  As mentioned in the
previous section, this kit guides you through creating HTML pages for
your snippets and notes that are automatically rendered using the
[TeXMe][texme] parser, the same parser used by MathB.in.  This ensures
that the parsing accuracy, rendering quality, and Markdown
compatibility remain just as reliable.
